# LeNet-5-from-scratch

This repository contains the implementation of LeNet-5 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Architecture from scratch using numpy. LeNet-5 is a pioneering architecture in the field of deep learning, particularly for handwritten digit classification on the MNIST dataset, developed in the 90s by Yann LeCun.

## Table of Content
1. **models/** - A directory storing Pickle files for pre-trained models for inference
2. **modules/** - A directory comprises of the implementation of the layers, loss functions, optimizers and all other modules of the model
3. **LeNet5_RBF_model.ipynb** - The implementation of LeNet-5 with the original RBF output layer
4. **LeNet5_softmax_model.ipynb** - The implementation of LeNet-5 with softmax output for higher prediction accuracy
5. **app.py** - The implementation of the handwritten digit recognition app with LeNet-5 as the model using tkinter
